MarkerJs
========

Private bookmarker
MarkerJs is a private bookmarking system to allow easy x-browser compatibility without having to rely on a third-party provider (the solution is an easy-install node.js app)

- Node.Js app structure
- MVC pattern tests with node
- no express framework
- basic view engine rendering html and json
- basic templating (like... really really basic!)
- bookmarklets
- static files server module [node-static](https://github.com/cloudhead/node-static)
- knockout and jquery for the front
- live log
